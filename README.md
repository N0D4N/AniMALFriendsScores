# AniMALFriendsScores

### Summary  
Small (<300 lines of code) **unofficial** browser extension for showing scores from your friends MyAnimeList account on AniList anime or manga pages.

### Installation  
* Firefox   
  Extension is available on [Mozilla addon page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/animalfriendsscores/).

* Chrome  
  I don't use Chrome or Chromium, so I don't have any plans on publishing it to [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/). However there are ways to install extensions not from Chrome Web Store, here is one of them:
  1. Go to [releases page](https://github.com/N0D4N/AniMALFriendsScores/releases/latest).  
  2. Download `Source code.zip`.
  3. Unzip it.
  4. Open `chrome://extensions/`.
  5. Enable developer mode.
  6. Click on `Load unpacked` button.
  7. Select `src` subfolder of folder where you unzipped `Source code.zip`.
  8. You are done.
  9. (Optional) Press `Watch` button on the top of the page, select `Custom` option and make a mark before Releases section, so you will be notified on new updates, so you will be able to update extension manually.
    
### How does it look like?
Scores from MyAnimeList friends have thin white border around them.

Names were changed, in a browser your friends usernames names will be displayed correctly.
